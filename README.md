This was my final project for computer science 2

This program is c++ based which simulates an Employee Database

On startup, 20 preset employees are added to the db.

After that, the user will be asked to enter a series of operations they would like to perform that will be entered into a queue until the user quits.

Once the user quits adding operations to the queue, The program will execute the operations in the queue until it is empty.

The Operations availabe are: 
1. Add a new employee
2. Delete an employee
3. Index the records by a later specified field
4. Display all records
5. Complete a search 


Characteristics of an Employee:
- Id
- First Name
- Last Name
- Social 
- Age 
- Salary
